## Description 

[Visit the Deployed Site]() 

This project I used Javascript to modify the webpage of a password generator.
Befoe I worked on the page there was no way to actually creat a password.
With the work I did on the Javascript code you are now able to generate a password with a limited amount of 
characters and different types of characters, such as numbers, speacial characters, upper and lowercase characters.

me understand what i was and was not doing.
